# Personal fork behavior (0.4.1)

This fork uses `grok_spawn` for normal delegation. It launches `grok agent stdio`, inherits the host process environment and Grok configuration, and does not force a sandbox, model, approval mode, or leader setting. It is not read-only. Explicit model arguments still override the configured model. Shell aliases and environment variables unavailable to Codex are not imported. Interactive permission requests are cancelled and reported, not automatically approved.

Live tests on Grok 1.0.25 confirmed two-turn context retention. Sending during a running turn is rejected; wait or cancel before following up. Legacy worker/search/interactive tools retain their specialized behavior; use `grok_spawn` for this fork's normal workflow. The upstream documentation below describes those legacy defaults where it differs.

Local source: this repository. Install with `codex plugin marketplace add "$PWD"` then `codex plugin add grok-subagent@zuozhi-grok`. Start a new Codex task after installation.

# Architecture

## Design goal

The bridge is intentionally an orchestrator adapter, not another coding-agent framework. Codex decides what to delegate and verifies the outcome. The official Grok Build process owns Grok-specific authentication, inference, tools, and session semantics.

## Protocol path

```text
Codex task
  -> bundled grok-subagent skill
  -> MCP JSON-RPC over stdio
  -> mcp-server/server.mjs
  -> ACP JSON-RPC over stdio
  -> official `grok agent stdio`
  -> Grok/xAI service and local tools
```

The MCP server has no third-party runtime dependencies. Each external agent owns:

- one child `grok` process;
- one ACP `sessionId`;
- one active prompt turn at a time;
- bounded public answer text;
- recent plan and tool-status summaries;
- a monotonic progress revision, elapsed time, and bounded public-response preview;
- lifecycle state and sanitized errors.

## ACP lifecycle

1. Spawn Grok with `--no-auto-update`, the selected sandbox, model, automatic approval, and `agent stdio`.
2. Send ACP `initialize` with protocol version 1.
3. Use the official `cached_token` authentication method when advertised. Other Grok-supported environment authentication remains owned by the CLI.
4. Create a session with `session/new`, the target directory, no nested MCP servers, and additional orchestration rules.
5. Send the task with `session/prompt`.
6. Consume `session/update` events. Keep public message chunks, plan entries, and bounded tool metadata; discard thought chunks.
7. Let `grok_status` long-poll a newer progress revision for up to 30 seconds so the orchestration skill can relay visible progress without tight polling.
8. Keep the process alive for focused follow-ups until cancellation, close, or MCP shutdown.

The child process receives only a small system environment allowlist, supported Grok authentication variables, and variables explicitly named by the operator. Failed or timed-out sessions terminate their Grok process while retaining a bounded diagnostic summary.

## Isolated search mode

`grok_search` is intentionally outside the managed ACP lifecycle. The bridge launches the official Grok CLI once with:

- a private run directory under `~/.cache/grok-subagent/search-runs`;
- temporary `HOME` / `GROK_HOME` values containing only a copied auth file and a minimal config;
- tools limited to `x_search`, `web_search`, and `web_fetch`;
- model pinned to `grok-4.5`;
- no MCP, memory, plan mode, or nested subagents.

The search bridge is adapted from the MIT-licensed `sudoHG/codex-grok-search` project and returns Grok's complete answer without content filtering. Codex remains responsible for framing the research task and synthesizing the final user-facing answer.

## Interactive handoff mode

`grok_handoff_interactive` is intentionally outside the managed ACP lifecycle. On macOS it writes the sanitized handoff prompt to a mode-0600 temporary file, opens a new Terminal window, reads and removes that file, and starts the official interactive Grok TUI. Read-only handoffs use the read-only sandbox. Writing handoffs require a Git repository root and ask Grok to create an isolated worktree.

The MCP call returns after Terminal opens. The bridge does not retain the TUI process, session ID, transcript, or completion state. The user owns interaction and lifecycle from that point and must return to Codex explicitly for independent verification.

## Read-only mode

`grok_spawn_readonly` starts Grok with `--sandbox read-only`. The bridge accepts any readable absolute directory. Grok's sandbox is the enforcement boundary; the prompt also states that the session must not modify project files.

## Writing mode

`grok_spawn_worker` requires all of the following before process startup:

1. `confirm_write_scope` is true after explicit user authorization;
2. the target is an absolute directory;
3. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves exactly to that directory;
4. `.git` is a file, which is the normal marker of a linked Git worktree.

The process then starts with `--sandbox workspace`. The bridge never creates commits, pushes, merges, cherry-picks, or removes the worktree.

## Why automatic Grok approval is used

ACP integrations cannot depend on an interactive terminal approval prompt. The bridge therefore launches Grok in automatic-approval mode only after selecting an OS sandbox. Permissions decide whether Grok asks; the sandbox decides what the process can actually write. Writing mode adds the worktree precondition so even an approved edit is separated from the primary checkout.

This is defense in depth, not a claim of perfect isolation. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Resource bounds

- maximum three open Grok processes per bridge;
- 120,000 characters of retained public answer text per agent;
- 12,000 characters of retained stderr;
- 20 recent tool events;
- 30-minute maximum prompt timeout;
- 30-second maximum blocking result wait.

Closing the MCP server terminates all child Grok processes.
