Search update (0.4.2): `grok_search` reads only `models.web_search` from `~/.grok/config.toml` and passes it as `--model`. Missing or blank values fall back to `grok-4.5`. No model connection settings are copied; search isolation and authentication behavior are unchanged.

# Personal fork behavior (0.4.1)

This fork uses `grok_spawn` for normal delegation. It launches `grok agent stdio`, inherits the host process environment and Grok configuration, and does not force a sandbox, model, approval mode, or leader setting. It is not read-only. Explicit model arguments still override the configured model. Shell aliases and environment variables unavailable to Codex are not imported. Interactive permission requests are cancelled and reported, not automatically approved.

Live tests on Grok 1.0.25 confirmed two-turn context retention. Sending during a running turn is rejected; wait or cancel before following up. Legacy worker/search/interactive tools retain their specialized behavior; use `grok_spawn` for this fork's normal workflow. The upstream documentation below describes those legacy defaults where it differs.

Local source: this repository. Install with `codex plugin marketplace add "$PWD"` then `codex plugin add grok-subagent@zuozhi-grok`. Start a new Codex task after installation.

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added isolated `grok_search`, `grok_search_list`, and `grok_search_show` tools for Grok-native X, Reddit, and public-web research outside the current repository.
- Bundled a repository-free Grok search bridge adapted from the MIT-licensed `sudoHG/codex-grok-search` project.
- Extended the orchestration skill so current X/Twitter and Reddit research prefers `grok_search` before ordinary web search or project-scoped Grok agents.

### Security

- Search runs use a private cache under `~/.cache/grok-subagent/search-runs`, temporary HOME/GROK_HOME isolation, and only `x_search`, `web_search`, and `web_fetch`.
- Search mode still sends queries and retrieved public content to xAI; it reduces local repository exposure rather than claiming zero upload.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Added a macOS-only `grok_handoff_interactive` tool that opens the official Grok TUI in a new Terminal window with a Codex-authored task prompt.
- Added read-only and isolated-worktree access modes for user-supervised interactive handoffs.

### Security

- Interactive implementation handoffs cannot write directly to the primary checkout and do not authorize commits, pushes, publication, or changes outside the Grok-created worktree.
- Initial handoff prompts use mode-0600 temporary files and are removed by the launched Terminal command before Grok starts.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Added monotonic progress revisions, elapsed time, timestamped tool events, and a bounded public-response preview to Grok agent status.
- Added optional long-polling to `grok_status` through `after_revision` and `wait_seconds`.
- Made the orchestration skill relay material Grok progress and provide a user-visible heartbeat at least once per minute.

### Security

- Kept visible progress limited to public answer chunks, plan entries, tool metadata, and lifecycle state; private chain-of-thought remains discarded.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- Canonicalized project and worktree paths so symlinked roots, including macOS `/tmp`, are handled correctly.
- Made cancellation settle back to an idle session and terminated failed or timed-out Grok processes.
- Corrected MCP tool annotations and protocol-version negotiation.
- Required explicit write-scope confirmation for writing-agent follow-ups.
- Limited Grok child processes to a documented environment-variable allowlist.
- Added deterministic tests for worktree guards, lifecycle behavior, environment filtering, redaction, and protocol metadata.

### Changed

- Raised the minimum supported Node.js version to 22 and added Node.js 22/24 CI coverage.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Codex plugin and `$grok-subagent` orchestration skill.
- Dependency-free MCP-to-ACP bridge for the official Grok Build CLI.
- Read-only investigation mode.
- Linked-Git-worktree writing mode with explicit authorization guard.
- Agent status, result, follow-up, cancellation, close, and list tools.
- Bounded event retention and credential-shaped text sanitization.
- MCP smoke tests, authenticated end-to-end test, repository validation, and CI.
